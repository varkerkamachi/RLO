This is a plain text file.

doctest: Setup
>> require './hello'

You can write volumes of information here.

By the way, this is how the hello method works by default.

doctest: hello returns "Hello World!"
>> hello
=> "Hello World!"

You can also ask for someone by name.

doctest: I can greet someone by name
>> hello 'Andrew'
=> "Hello Andrew!"

If you hear a bump in the night you might use it this way.

doctest: I can ask if someone is there.
>> hello('Victor', '?')
=> "Hello Victor?"
